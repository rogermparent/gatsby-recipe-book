# Gatsby Recipe Book

https://github.com/rogermparent/gatsby-recipe-book/assets/9111807/98d1f871-e3ec-476a-a6af-1caff8d671da

This project aims to be a powerful tool for making static recipe websites with minimal requirements, leveraging cutting-edge web technologies like GatsbyJS in order to bring the best of all worlds to the oft-overlooked field of recipe websites.

## Features

- **Create, read, and update recipes from the UI without touching any code**
  The `editor` app has a full UI to manage recipe content, and uses Gatsby's hot-reloading development server to immediately display content changes as they're made. Use it locally, or host on your private network to edit from other devices!

- **Filter recipes by ingredient, category, or cuisine**
  With Gatsby's excellent data layer, this statically generated website can display any kind of data aggregation to make recipes easier to sort through.

- **Easy spin-up, tear-down, and backup**
  No need to worry about keeping special SQL database backups, just use tools the operate on files! Use version control software like Git to add the ability to track and reverse changes.

## This project is also a testbed

As much as this project aims to be a useful solution to the issue of making a good recipe website, it is also a testbed for the implementation of a new kind of pattern for SSGs that enables UI-driven applications without the usual burden of a custom SQL-dependent server.
